## Project Checklist

- [x] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created. — Confirmed file exists and initialized checklist.
- [x] Clarify Project Requirements (User requested Django-based Library Management System with roles, dashboards, DRF, responsive UI, deployment guides, and synthetic data generation) — Requirements logged and referenced in docs/implementation-plan.md.
- [x] Scaffold the Project (Initialized Django project with virtualenv, core apps, and dependencies) — Django project created with virtualenv, core apps, and baseline settings.
- [x] Customize the Project — Implemented role-aware models, views, APIs, and responsive Bootstrap templates per requirements.
- [x] Install Required Extensions — No extensions specified by tooling; skipped installation.
- [x] Compile the Project — `manage.py check` passes with no issues.
- [x] Create and Run Task — Added `runserver` task invoking `${workspaceFolder}\venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py runserver`.
- [x] Launch the Project — Verified `runserver_plus` HTTPS launch and exercised key routes.
- [x] Ensure Documentation is Complete — Added README with setup, HTTPS launch, and data seeding instructions.

## Guidelines

- Work through each checklist item systematically and keep progress up to date.
- Avoid verbose explanations or excessive command output; state when steps are skipped.
- Use the project root (`.`) as the working directory unless instructed otherwise.
- Only install VS Code extensions if explicitly required by tooling.
- Ensure generated components serve clear project requirements and clarify assumptions when needed.
- Confirm completion once the project builds cleanly, documentation is current, and launch instructions are provided.
